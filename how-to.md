This document will give you a list of things to review before participating in a [Trace Labs CTF](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/search-party). The items are in no particular order, however all should be reviewed in detail before the day of the CTF. 

Note that the terms, "Trace Labs CTF", "Search Party CTF" and "CTF" are all used interchangably in this document. 

# Reading Recommendations
There's a lot to read and go over prior to a CTF. We suggest becoming familiar with all these materials in the month prior.

## The Trace Labs OSINT Field Manual
An open-source document in Github, the [Trace Labs OSINT Field Manual](https://github.com/tracelabs/tofm) offers up general, beginner-level information about some of the skills, knowledge and tasks related to using OSINT to find missing persons within a Trace Labs initiative. It talks about scoping your work, safety concerns for yourself and others, ethical considerations, planning, and technical considerations. It's worth a read, even if you're already a veteran with Trace Labs CTFs. 

## The Trace Labs Contestant and Coaches Guides
Whether you've chosen to be a Participant or Coach, you'll want to read both of these guides to prepare yourself for the CTF. Why both? 

If you're a Participant, understanding what Coaches are looking for helps you understand what to submit and what to include in your submissions. Every CTF we see teams not understanding which categories to use when submitting intel and not providing enough documentation to support their findings. Both of these topics are covered in both Guides, but it's easier to understand 

If you're a Coach, your role is to support your teams and vet their intelligence, all while providing helpful advice as needed. Therefore, you'll want to understand the Participants perspectives; reading through their Guide is a good start. 

## Previous CTF Write Ups
Some Participants and Coaches have created write ups about their experiences with a Trace Labs CTF, and they have been compiled [here](https://github.com/tracelabs/searchparty-ctf-writeups/blob/master/searchparty-ctf-writeups.md). Many of these suggest tips, tricks and methodologies that both Coaches and Participants will find useful. 

# Operational Security, or OpSec
Operational security refers to an action one takes to stop bad actors from accessing personal or sensitive information, usually through blocking access. There's a channel in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y) dedicated to OpSec. 

As you've likely read in the [Trace Labs OSINT Field Manual](https://github.com/tracelabs/tofm), you'll need to assess your own risks with participating in the CTF, and determine what you'll need to do prior to the event to keep your details safe. With OSINT, this generally means not using personal devices for professional work, creating sock puppet social media accounts, utilizing a VM or VPN, and ensuring you're using 'no-touch' tools and methods. 

## No-Touch Tools and Methods
By no-touch, we mean no liking, commenting, friending or joining closed access groups to gather information (example: Facebook private groups, pay-to-access Patreon groups, etc.). We also mean no password resets, interviewing people, or otherwise connecting with people in any way. Therefore, if you plan on using tools during your CTF experience, triple check to make sure they do not use any sort of active measures to collect data. 

It's surprisingly easy to accidentally like a video on some social media sites, so take this into account during your planning period. And in some instances, such as Instagram's Stories, users can view who watched their Story in the past 24 hours. A good workaround for avoiding accidental likes is to use a site that allows you to view accounts anonymously, like [InstaStoriesViewer](https://insta-stories-viewer.com) or [Facebook Social Searcher](https://www.social-searcher.com/facebook-search/).

We'll discuss no-touch tools and methods a bit more in the ethics section of this document. 

## VM or VPN?
It's up to you whether or not you want to use a personal computer or mobile device while participating in a Trace Labs CTF (although we don't recommend submitting intel to the Search Party Platform from a mobile device). Since you're volunteering, it's not practical to have a device dedicated to OSINT, so that's where VMs and VPNs come in handy. 

While Trace Labs doesn't require Participants or Coaches to use a Virtual Machine (VM) or Virtual Private Network (VPN), it is strongly recommended to pick one and use it for the entirety of the CTF. The [Trace Labs VM](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/osint-vm) is a available to all for download, and is free to use. There are many free VPNs to choose from, and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/features/free-vpn) now offers a free VPN as part of it's browser. However, it's wise to review the policies of any free (or paid) VPN provider before using them, as many in both categories do not mask your ID completely. Paid options with privacy protections include Proton VPN and Mullvad. There's also a channel in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y) dedicated to the Trace Labs VM. 

Tip: change your VPN to match the location of the area of the missing person you're trying to locate, and change it every time you switch cases. This is something to test prior to the CTF however, as some social media networks will block you if you try to do this too much, or at all. 

## Sock Puppet Accounts
If you plan on using social media during your OSINT work for the CTF, you'll want to use sock puppet accounts. Socks, or sock puppets, are social media accounts with 'fake' information added, so that they cannot be traced back to you personally. Create your accounts well before the event so that you're not scrambling an hour beforehand. Aim for, at the minimum, accounts with Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram and TikTok. Reddit, Google, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, Pinterest, YouTube and Snapchat can also come in handy. 

Trace Labs has two YouTube videos on this topic: [Introduction to Setting Up Sock Puppets for OSINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KPO58wkw7M), and [An Evening With the Puppet Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEeJcZhxAf4). There's also a channel in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y) called Sockpuppet Questions, for more help and advice. 

# Teamwork
You can participate as a team of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people in a Search Party CTF. To help faciliate people meeting one another for this purpose, a few weeks before every Search Party event a channel opens in the Trace Labs Discord server called Team Matching. This is where people seeking a team or teammates can post their requests. You can self-select the role needed to gain access to this channel in the Channel & Roles section of the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y).

Once you've found (or reuinted with) a team, you'll want to meet at least once before the CTF. Some discussion suggestions:
* Does anyone have an OSINT specialty, or area of expertise? How experienced is everyone?
* What methodology will we use as a team to tackle the cases? (Many successful teams find it easier for each person to take one missing person case, and then rotate the cases every x number of minutes).
* Who will communicate with the Coach? (It's easier if one person is dedicated to speaking with your assigned Coach, but this doesn't work for every team).
* What happens if someone hits a wall or can't continue? What if someone is on a roll but it's time to switch cases?
* How do you like to perform OSINT? Do you work better if you can see your teammates (say through a Discord server created just for the CTF, where everyone jumps on a video or voice chat)? Are you easily distracted? Do you need to ask for help or advice often or do you prefer to work solo?
* Who is responsible for checking to see if submitted intelligence was accepted? How often will this happen?
* Does anyone have a cheat sheet, start.me bookmarks, or list of resources already compiled that the team can refer to?
* Are we a competitive team, looking to improve our skills, or something else?

Four hours might seem like a long time, but it goes by in a flash. Plan for it. 

It's also recommended that teams meet up 30 minutes before the CTF to make sure everyone can access the Search Party Platform and Trace Labs Discord server, as well as prep their sock puppets and work out any last minute kinks. 

# Coach Communications - For Coaches and Participants
At some point during the CTF, if a Coach needs to speak with their team, or a team needs to speak with their Coach, we recommend starting in the Participant Discord channel, first. If you can't figure out who your team or Coach is, please ping Leadership. If you don't get a response, open a support ticket and add the Coach or Participant you need to speak with. 

Some teams like to pre-emptively open a support ticket before a CTF, add their team members, and then add their Coach when one gets assigned to them. However, we can't have hundreds of teams doing this - it would break the Discord server. So, where possible, hold off on opening a support ticket until or if you actually need it. 

# Ethical Considerations
One of the reasons why Trace Labs has a "no-touch" policy about OSINT relates to ethics. (As a reminder, this means we do not allow any tactics that include things like password resets, contact with anyone connected to the missing person such as friends or family, or active OSINT). The goal is to leave no trace behind and do no harm. 

With this mind, there are a few things to consider when participating in a CTF: 
- Think about the tools and techniques you're using. Are they truly passive? Do they really leave no trace behind? Example: a tool searches hundreds of Facebook groups for the missing person's name, which leads to their name trending on Facebook. What if the family sees this?
- Consider whether or not you will use AI with sensitive information. Even if you have opted-out of using your inputs for training, there's no guarantee a service will not use the information for training purposes (and free solutions don't offer this as an option). Example: you put some of the missing person's personal details that you found into ChatGPT to figure out how best to word a submission. What if the person is subsequently found safe? How will they know to have their personal information removed from ChatGPT? 
- Plan to remove all information relating to the CTF after the event concludes.
- If you decide to create a write up about your experiences, make sure to mask any personal information about the missing persons cases, including names and any identifying details. Check with your teammates and Coach if it's okay to refer to them, and how they want to be referred to if they consent. 

# Mental Health
[How to Maintain Mental Hygiene as an Open Source Researcher](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/11/23/how-to-maintain-mental-hygiene-as-an-open-source-researcher/), is an excellent primer, that includes steps to take to reduce the possibility of secondary trauma. 

There is also a dedicated channel in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y) for mental health as well as mental health resources. 

# Some Tips & Tricks
These items don't fall well into any other category, but they're useful information and good to know before the CTF. 

## The Search Party Platform
This step gets covered in the pre-CTF YouTube briefings, although previous (old) briefings can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz26mOwsse0&list=PLlaJQR699XLt4ib7yWgvaWM7KA12uTlB9). But, it bears repeating, as there are always people who forget they need to log into the Search Party Platform in order to participate. Nutshell: you should have received the necessary information to log in when you secured your ticket in Eventbrite. Access becomes available approximately 24 hours before the CTF. Set yourself a reminder to check it, and make sure it works. 

## Support Tickets
Make sure you're part of the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y) and have access to either the Participant or Coach channel the night before the CTF. Also, review how to open a support ticket - many people don't open these correctly, and end up wondering why no one got back to them. To open a support ticket: 
* Go to the Channels & Roles channel of the Discord server, and select the Support Ticket option. (If it is already selected, de-select it and then select it again).
* Navigate to the support-ticket channel in the Discord server, and type `-ticket open Reason for ticket` where you replace the words `Reason for ticket` with a short explanation of why you're opening the ticket. 
* A new channel should pop up, this is your support ticket channel and is only viewable by yourself and Leadership.
* If you need to add someone else to the support ticket, such as a team member or Coach, type `-ticket adduser username` within this newly created channel, and replace `username` with the Discord username of the individual you want to add. 
* When your question gets answered, please close the support ticket by typing `-ticket close Reason for closing ticket` where you replace `Reason for closing ticket` with your reason for closing this specific ticket.

## Dorks, Boolean Operators & Search Engines
Whther you call them dorks or boolean operators, they're all the same thing: special characters or terms you can use in most search engines to show you information you can't normally find. Every search engine has their own, so have a list of your favorites nearby, ready to use during the CTF. Here's a [Google Dork Cheatsheet](https://github.com/robyfirnandoyusuf/Google-Dork-Cheatsheet), [DuckDuckGo's advanced syntax](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/) and [DorkGPT](https://www.dorkgpt.com) to get you started (just remember, we only accept passive OSINT for Search Party CTFs). 

## Submission Categories
A common error for new CTF Participants is to submit intelligence under the wrong category. Don't fall into this trap by having the list of categories in front of you, with the respective items that belong in it. There's a handy, printable version in both the Coach and Participant Guides, mentioned earlier in this document. 

## Note Taking System or App
It can get confusing when working with 4-6 cases in four hours, especially if some missing persons have similar details. Plus, your teammates are also submitting intelligence alongside you, so you'll need to make sure you're not duplicating your efforts. Or, if you're a Coach, you'll need to keep track of which team has submitted what (as oftentimes multiple teams will find the exact same intelligence). 

That's why we recommend using some form of note taking, either pen and paper, or an app. Just make sure to destroy your notes afterwards, especially if they hold any sensitive information. And don't forget to vet any note taking apps that you use for ethical considerations; most of the major providers make your notes readable to the service provider. 

## Screenshot App
A great screenshot app will become your best friend during a CTF. As there's only room for one image, you've got to make it count. 

First off, try to submit an image for every piece of intelligence you submit. We never know when someone will take down a post or delete their account. 

Then, make sure the image is descriptive - add text or collage multiple images, if needed. Don't give us a screenshot of someone's entire Facebook page - It's unnecessarily large, and difficult to view. Screenshot the exact information you want to show - an image with a highlighted address in the background, one specific comment in a thread, the second where you can see the missing person in a video. Your image should tell us a clear story, with your text filling in any gaps. 

## Direct Links
Did you know that on some social media sites, you can link directly to one specific comment? When submitting intelligence for a CTF, please use the most specific URL you can, directing your Coach to the information you've uncovered. That means a post instead of search results, a post instead of a general account page, or a comment in a sea of hundreds of comments. For videos, that means providing the direct link, and then explaining in your commentary the exact timestamp where the information can be found. 

# Troubleshooting & How To Ask For Help
While this isn't something to do prior to a CTF, you may want to know this information just in case you need it. 

If you've encountered an issue that needs immediate, urgent review, please tag Leadership in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y), by adding an @ sign immediately before the word Leadership. Please do not share sensitive information, but do share general details so someone can private message you to discuss. 

If the issue is not urgent, CTF-related AND requires sharing sensitive information, please open a support ticket in the [Trace Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsMRbX4y). 

For Coaches needing a second opinion or review, use the Discord channel specifically created for Coaches, and tag the Senior Coaches. 

For all other non-urgent inquiries, please ask in the appropriate CTF channel on the Trace Labs Discord server.
