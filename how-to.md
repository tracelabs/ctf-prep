This document will give you a list of things to review before participating in a [Trace Labs CTF](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/search-party). The items are in no particular order, however all should be reviewed in detail before the day of the CTF. 

Note that the terms, "Trace Labs CTF", "Search Party CTF" and "CTF" are all used interchangably in this document. 

# Reading Recommendations
There's a lot to read and go over prior to a CTF. We suggest becoming familiar with all these materials in the month prior to the event. 

## The Trace Labs OSINT Field Manual
An open-source document in Github, the [Trace Labs OSINT Field Manual](https://github.com/tracelabs/tofm) offers up general, beginner-level information about some of the skills, knowledge and tasks related to using OSINT to find missing persons within a Trace Labs initiative. It talks about scoping your work, safety concerns for yourself and others, ethical considerations, planning, and technical considerations. It's worth a read, even if you're already a veteran with Trace Labs CTFs. 

## The Trace Labs Contestant and Coaches Guides
Whether you've chosen to be a Participant or Coach, you'll want to read both of these guides to prepare yourself for the CTF. Why both? 

If you're a Participant, understanding what Coaches are looking for helps you understand what to submit and what to include in your submissions. Every CTF we see teams not understanding which categories to use when submitting intel and not providing enough documentation to support their findings. Both of these topics are covered in both Guides, but it's easier to understand 

If you're a Coach, your role is to support your teams and vet their intelligence, all while providing helpful advice as needed. Therefore, you'll want to understand the Participants perspectives; reading through their Guide is a good start. 

## Previous CTF Write Ups
Some Participants and Coaches have created write ups about their experiences with a Trace Labs CTF, and they have been compiled [here](https://github.com/tracelabs/searchparty-ctf-writeups/blob/master/searchparty-ctf-writeups.md). Many of these suggest tips, tricks and methodologies that both Coaches and Participants will find useful.

# Operational Security


## VM or VPN?
While Trace Labs doesn't require Participants or Coaches to use a Virtual Machine (VM) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) during a Search Party CTF event, it is strongly recommended to pick one and use it for the entirety of the CTF. The [Trace Labs VM](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/osint-vm) is a available to all for download, and is free to use. There are many free VPNs to choose from, and Opera now offers a free VPN as part of it's browser. However, it's wise to review the policies of any free (or paid) VPN provider before using them, as many in both categories do not mask your ID completely. Good paid options with privacy protections include Proton VPN and Mullvad. 

Tip: change your VPN to match the location of the area of the missing person you're trying to locate, and change it every time you switch cases. This is something to test prior to the CTF however, as some social media networks will block you if you try to do this too much, or at all. 

## Sock Puppet Accounts
If you plan on using social media during your OSINT work for the CTF, you'll want to use sock puppet accounts. Socks, or sock puppets, are social media accounts with 'fake' information added, so that they cannot be traced back to you personally. Create your accounts well before the event so that you're not scrambling an hour beforehand. Aim for, at the minimum, accounts with Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram and TikTok. Reddit, Google, WhatsApp, Telegram, WeChat, Pinterest, YouTube and Snapchat can also come in handy. 

Trace Labs has two YouTube videos on this topic: [Introduction to Setting Up Sock Puppets for OSINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KPO58wkw7M), and [An Evening With the Puppet Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEeJcZhxAf4).

# Teamwork
You can participate as a team of 1, 2, 3 or 4 people in a Search Party CTF. A few weeks before every event, a channel opens in the Trace Labs Discord server called Team Matching. This is where people seeking a team or teammates can post their requests. 

- meeting beforehand to discuss methodology, specialities, who will communicate with the Coach

# Coach Communications - For Coaches and Participants


# Ethical Considerations



# Mental Health
Everyone working with Trace Labs during a Search Party event is a volunteer, including Leadership and Staff members. 

# Things To Join, Do, and Set Up
- Discord server, create a support channel with designated team member + coach once they're assigned
- Join the major social media sites and harden your socks, then check them all the day before the CTF
- set up a list of search engines to use, dorks / boolean operators
- print or write out the list of categories with their respective items to have on hand
- note taking app or system, to keep track of submitted intelligence (note AI / sharing)
- screenshot app that allows you to add text or combine multiple images to tell a story
